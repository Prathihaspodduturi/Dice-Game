# Dice-Game
Dice Game is a simple, fun, and interactive dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played by two players who take turns to roll a dice and accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points or more. Players can either roll the dice and add the rolled number to their current score or hold their score, which adds the current score to their total and passes the turn to the other player. However, rolling a 1 forfeits their turn and their current score.
